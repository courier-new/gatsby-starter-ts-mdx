description: Reinventing the wheel on every new project stinks
---
I generally approach new coding projects the way I approach new cooking projects- skim as many recipes as possible online until it is too late to make any of them and cobble some hybrid together on my own. I did that with this [gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) site too, jumping back and forth between sass module css + styled components, wordpress and netlify and retaining only pieces of various examples from each. Basically I was never going to launch this thing- what a mess.

In the end, alone in my apartment during a miserable winter storm, I sat down and got the bulk of this wired up in a few hours using only **2** different repos and the official gatsby + netlify documentation.

I think of myself as someone who enjoys writing code because it is an inherently creative endevor. Maybe I don't like following someone else's directions when I *should* be able to just Figure It Out for myself. Or maybe my brain is broken- It's hard enough to read a short story or piece of journalism without getting distracted.

Gatsby also has all sorts of unique conventions- a global `graphql` function, an expectation that you will export a graphql query using this function, its own `Link` component. I would find one of these quirks, or notice two different walkthroughs doing something slightly different, and go down a rabbit hole comparing each step, each bit of source code to figure out the difference. I deployed to github pages and then netlify. Netlify couldn't resolve the images that were working for me locally. I started from scratch and as far as I can tell ended up in the exact same place, but now images were working. It's taking a lot of willpower to not go back and look at my previous work to find that missing piece.

Anyhow Hello World
