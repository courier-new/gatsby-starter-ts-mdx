<h1 align="center">
  Erik's Gatsby 2019 setup
</h1>

_Heavily inspired by
https://github.com/damassi/gatsby-starter-typescript-rebass-netlifycms_

I've done my best to keep commits for this setup step-by-step in hope others
might understand the process better and avoid some of the endless faffing I went
through.

By default this starter has both mdx and markdown/remark extensions. MDX seems a
better fit for styled-components, so check the `disable-remark` branch for a
rough diff on how to accomplish that.

### TODOs:

- [ ] Netlify CMS may have broken?
- [ ] Relative imports for MDX Global Scoped components not working from
      gatsby-config
